Generating the EventBundle

For now run the generate:bundle command:

$ php app/console generate:bundle

Важно - название бандла должно обязательно содержать слово "Bundle"

For the bundle namespace, type Yoda/EventBundle. 
A bundle namespace always has two parts: a vendor name and a name describing the bundle. 
In honor of the Jedi master, we’ll use “Yoda” for the first part and EventBundle for the second. 
Unless you also work for Yoda, you’ll probably use your company or project name instead. 
Keep these as short as possible to save typing later.

Next, it wants a nickname for our bundle. We’re going to be writing this a lot, and lets face it, we’re busy people. 
So, let’s choose something short, like EventBundle. The only rule is that this ends with Bundle.

Use the target default directory, but choose yml as the configuration format. 
You’ll just have to trust me on this part - we’ll check out the annotation configuration format later.

For the rest of the questions, just hit the enter key wildly. 
And once the console-gnomes are finished, we have a brand new bundle.
